* hledger: Make It So

Inspired by the structure and ideas of [[https://github.com/adept/full-fledged-hledger/wiki][adept's Full-fledged Hledger]].

** Goals

Adept's goals resonated with me:

- Tracking expenses should take as little time, effort and manual work as possible

- Eventual consistency should be achievable: even if I can't record something precisely right now, maybe I would be able to do it later, so I should be able to leave things half-done and pick them up later

- Ability to refactor is a must. I want to be able to go back and change the way I am doing things, with as little effort as possible and without fear of irrevocably breaking things.
