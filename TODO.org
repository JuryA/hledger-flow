* The TODO List
** Generate reports
   - Monthly reports for the past 6 months
   - Quarterly reports for the past year
   - Yearly reports for the past 5 years
   - How much money went towards expenses, assets and liabilities, expressed as a percentage of income
   - My personal inflation: percentage increase in expenses per year
   - Overall reports, and reports per owner
   - More useful reports?
** Performance
   - Generate reports in parallel
   - Don't re-process statements that have already been processed
** Documentation
   - Expand the step-by-step instructions with more scenarios
** Random Thoughts
   - First build a list of actions, then perform the actions
