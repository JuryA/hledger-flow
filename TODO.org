* The TODO List
** Unintended features - not bugs
*** When running =hledger-makeitso import= in the wrong directory, an empty =import-all.journal= is created in that dir.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ mkdir /tmp/makeitso-test
$ ll /tmp/makeitso-test/
total 0
$ hledger-makeitso import /tmp/makeitso-test/
hledger-makeitso: user error (Unable to find CSV import dir at /tmp/makeitso-test/import)
$ cat /tmp/makeitso-test/import-all.journal

** Script Hooks
*** Create the =2-preprocessed= output path before calling =preprocess=
*** Stop executing if any script hook exits with a non-zero exit status
*** Support a fully custom =import= script that can generate complete journal files without using =hledger import=
**** Background info: [[https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/627#issuecomment-343324248][the script in this issue]] made me think how advanced use cases can be supported
**** This can either be an alternative to =preprocess=, or in addition to it
**** The =import= script will take an input file as the first parameter and output fully formed journal entries to stdout
**** The stdout should then be piped to =hledger print= to get validation and standard indentation/formatting
** Generate reports
*** Monthly reports for the past 6 months
*** Quarterly reports for the past year
*** Yearly reports for the past 5 years
*** How much money went towards expenses, assets and liabilities, expressed as a percentage of income
*** More useful reports?
** Performance
*** Process statements in parallel
*** Generate reports in parallel
*** Don't re-process statements that have already been processed
** Documentation
*** Ensure that the error messages guide the user to the next action, with helpful links
*** Create an example user with a life that can be used for example financial transactions
** Random Thoughts
*** Instead of assuming a rigid structure under =import=, start by find all input files in =*in=
**** Assume as little as possible about the structure, get account, bank and year dirs as relative to input files
**** First build a list of actions, then perform the actions
