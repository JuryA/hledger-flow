* The TODO List
** Script Hooks
*** Supply only input and output files to =preprocess= script. Do not assume input is a CSV file
*** Support a fully custom =import= script that can generate complete journal files without using =hledger import=
**** This can either be an alternative to =preprocess=, or in addition to it
**** The =import= script will take an input file as the first parameter and output fully formed journal entries to stdout
**** The stdout should then be piped to =hledger print= to get validation and standard indentation/formatting
** Generate reports
*** Monthly reports for the past 6 months
*** Quarterly reports for the past year
*** Yearly reports for the past 5 years
*** How much money went towards expenses, assets and liabilities, expressed as a percentage of income
*** More useful reports?
** Performance
*** Process statements in parallel
*** Generate reports in parallel
*** Don't re-process statements that have already been processed
** Random Thoughts
*** Instead of assuming a rigid structure under =import=, start by find all input files in =1-in=
**** Assume as little as possible about the structure, get account, bank and year dirs as relative to input files
**** First build a list of actions, then perform the actions
