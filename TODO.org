* The TODO List
** Script Hooks
   - Stop executing if any script hook exits with a non-zero exit status
   - Pass the owner as a parameter to =preprocess= and =import=
   - Rename the =import= script to something else, e.g. =convert=?
     To avoid confusion with the import directory.
** Rules Files
   - Does =hledger= accept multiple rules files as parameters?
** Generate reports
   - Monthly reports for the past 6 months
   - Quarterly reports for the past year
   - Yearly reports for the past 5 years
   - How much money went towards expenses, assets and liabilities, expressed as a percentage of income
   - Overall reports, and reports per owner
   - More useful reports?
** Performance
   - Process statements in parallel
   - Generate reports in parallel
   - Don't re-process statements that have already been processed
** Documentation
   - Ensure that the error messages guide the user to the next action, with helpful links
   - Expand the step-by-step instructions with more scenarios
** Random Thoughts
   - Instead of assuming a rigid structure under =import=, start by find all input files in =*in=
     Assume as little as possible about the structure, get account, bank and year dirs as relative to input files
   - First build a list of actions, then perform the actions
