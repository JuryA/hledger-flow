* The TODO List
** Script Hooks
*** Stop executing if any script hook exits with a non-zero exit status
** Generate reports
*** Monthly reports for the past 6 months
*** Quarterly reports for the past year
*** Yearly reports for the past 5 years
*** How much money went towards expenses, assets and liabilities, expressed as a percentage of income
*** Overall reports, and reports per owner
*** More useful reports?
** Performance
*** Process statements in parallel
*** Generate reports in parallel
*** Don't re-process statements that have already been processed
** Documentation
*** Ensure that the error messages guide the user to the next action, with helpful links
*** Create an example user with a life that can be used for example financial transactions
** Random Thoughts
*** Instead of assuming a rigid structure under =import=, start by find all input files in =*in=
**** Assume as little as possible about the structure, get account, bank and year dirs as relative to input files
**** First build a list of actions, then perform the actions
