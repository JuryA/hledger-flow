* The TODO List
** Write an aggregate journal file in the parent dir of any dir with journal files in it.
** Add an =opening-closing.journal= file in every account directory for opening and closing balances.
** Find all input files in =1-in=, get account, bank and year dirs as relative to input files
** Assume as little as possible about the structure, get account, bank and year dirs as relative to input files
** Supply only input and output files to =preprocess= script. Do not assume input is a CSV file
** Support a fully custom =import= script that can generate complete journal files without using =hledger import=
*** This can either be an alternative to =preprocess=, or in addition to it
*** The =import= script will take an input file as the first parameter and output fully formed journal entries to stdout
*** The stdout should then be piped to =hledger print= to get validation and standard indentation/formatting
** Generate reports
